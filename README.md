# WorkScheduleCalendarApplication
## The program calculates whether the user will have enough time to complete the work (i.e., write a thesis).
## For that purpose, the user's plans are collected from the Google Calendar, they are evaluated, and it is calculated whether there will be enough time to complete the work.
## Finally, the program schedules how many hours each day needs to be worked to get the job done on time.
## To connect to Google Calendar you have to generate credentials.json file in Google Cloud and save it in resource package.
